hacking =  (''''What is hacking?

In 1990s, the term "hacker" originally 
denoted a skilled programmer proficient in machine code and computer operating systems.
But those hackers also became experts at accessing password-protected computers, files, and networks and came to known as "crackers." So any expert "cracker" must to be a good hacker and the terms became intertwined. 

After this, the word "hacker" won out in popular use and in the media and today refers to anyone who performs some form of computer sabotage.

Types of hackers:

Black hat hacker:
These are criminals who intentionally break into system to stole information or money. They usually hack devices for selfish purposes.

Grey hat hacker:
They are hackers motivated by profit as well as ethical reasons. They use illegal and legal actions to exploit a system. They access to a person's system and, inform them about vulnerability found and suggest how to improve security.

White hat hacker:
These hackers are also known as "Ethical Hackers", they only hack systems and devices to find vulnerabilities to make them more efficient and secure. This is a little bit difficult that's why they form communities to share their knowledge.

They can be hired by companies, organizations or the goverment to protect their system finding vulnerabilities and make certain jobs. Ethical hackers can earn up to $9,940 USD monthly or more and $119,289 USD annually.''')

wifi = ('''What is WiFi?

WiFi is a technology that uses radio waves to provide network connectivity. A connection is established using a wireless adapter to create hotspots areas in the vicinity of a wireless router that are connected to the network and allow users to access internet services.

How it works?

WiFi network works using radio waves to transmit information across a network. The computer should include a wireless adapter that will translate data sent into a radio signal. This same signal will be transmitted, via an antenna, to a decoder known as the router. Once decoded, the data will be sent to the Internet through a wired Ethernet connection.

How to protect WiFi?

Don't use public WIFI to make transactions or do an important operation because hackers can easily access to your stored data.
But if it is very important, use a VPN to connect to WiFi.

If your router is left unsecured, someone could access and use it for illegal activities with your name, track your internet, stole your bank information, use or even install malware.

If you look at the security of a wireless network, a few options will be available. These choices will include none, WEP, WPA, WPA2-Personal, WPA2-Enterprise and possibly WPA3, older devices aren't able to support WPA3.
You must to use the best security method according to the capacity of your device, use WPA2 or WPA3, the highest number is a more secure connection.

Now if you want to hack into someone's WiFi, then you go to the link below but before let me tell you that if you want to know whether a WiFi connection is weak or strong, then you should use a WiFi hacker app, that in deep they don't hack anything but just give you all details about a connection like IP address, WEP, WPA, WPA2 and more, so you'll know more details for pentesting.

programming = ('''Programming is a fundamental base for hacking, it is very important, although you can hack without it but if you learn programming you'll be more expert, so you need to improve your hacking skills.

First of all, it helps you understand how programs, websites and apps work. There are a lot of programming languages and the main ones you must try to learn are Python, C, Java, C#.

These programming languages are an important tool for hacking, so let's learn the most important parts of any programming language, in this case I'll teach a little bit of Java this applies for others too:

•A comment is a part of the code that won't be executed, to type a comment we use two slashes //, in python is a #,  we can use them to type notes in the code.
Example: //This is a comment

•A variable is used to save data temporally and operate with it, there are different types of variables: integer, float, string, boolean.

•Conditional operators are used to control functions of the code, there are different types: if, while, for.
We can use "if" to say that if something is true, then the code do the action we want.

•A list is used to save or show data of any thing, as contacts, notes, images and as this hacking course.
Types of lists: liststring, listmap, list number.

•Widgets are used to do an action with components, here we can find:

1.EditText is where we type texts. 2.TextView is used to display texts. 
3.Button is used to perform an action when you click on it.
4.LinearLayout is used to put more widgets.
5.ScrollView is used to scroll linears horizontally or vertically.
6.Switch is used to switch actions.
7.Checkbox is used to check whether an action is true or false.
8.ImageView is to display images.
9.ListView shows data of a liststring or listmap.
10.WebView is used to load a specific url.

•Components are used to use device functions:

1.Calendar is used to get date and time.
2.Camera is used to take pictures or videos.
3.Dialog is used to create a pop-up.
4.Intent is used to start a new activity, as a call.
5.MediaPlayer is used to play long audios.
6.TextToSpeech is used to convert text to speech.
7.SpeechToText is used to convert speech to text.
8.Timer is used to delay some actions.
9.SoundPool is used to play short audios.
10.Vibrator is used to vibrate the device.

Tools to start making your own applications:

Aide: Aide is an good app to create apps, it works with different programing languages, here you'll find a lot of tools and programming courses.

Sketchware: it is an useful app for beginners, you can create your own apps easily using Java with blocks like Scratch.

Android Studio: Android studio is an excellent program for expert level in programming, you can create the apps you want. This is one of the most used programs to build apps.
 
If you face any kind of bug, you can ask for help in the biggest community of developers "Stackoverflow".''')

malwares = ('''What is a Malware?

It is the abbreviation of "Malicious software", a term that includes all types of data program or codes, in this group we can find terms like:

Viruses, Trojans, Worms, Keyloggers, Botnets, Ransomwares, Spyware, Adware, Hijackers, Keyloggers, FakeAVs, Rootkits, Bootkits, Rogues and more.

Let's learn more of them:

1.Viruses need an already-infected active operating system or program to work. Viruses are typically attached to an executable file or a word document.

Usually spread via infected websites, file sharing, or email attachment downloads, a virus will lie dormant until the infected host file or program is activated.

2.Worms are spread via software vulnerabilities or phishing attacks. Once a worm has installed itself into your computer’s memory, it starts to infect the whole machine and in some cases… your whole network.

These parasitic nasties can:
•Modify and delete files.
•Inject malicious software onto computers.
•Replicate themselves over and over to deplete system resources.
•Steal your data.
•Install a convenient backdoor for hackers.

3.Spyware secretly records your online activity, harvesting your data and collecting personal information such as usernames, passwords and surfing habits.

Once on your computer, spyware relays your data to advertisers or cyber criminals. Some spywares install additional malwares that make changes to your settings.

4.Pishing is a type of email hacking, a common method of cyber attack.
Phishing is successful since the emails sent, text messages and web links created look like they’re from trusted sources.

In this case the hacker sends a clone page of a particular website, when the victim clicks the link, it will be sent to the clone page and without realizing, the victim types its credentials in the clone page and it will redirected to the original website, the hacker will get the username and password.

5.Adware is one of the better-known types of malware. It serves pop-ups and display ads that often have no relevance to you.

Some users will put up with certain types of adware in return for free software (as games).
This can slow down your device or worst, the ads link to sites where malicious downloads await unsuspecting users. Adware can also deliver Spyware and is often easily hacked, making devices that have it installed a soft target for hackers, phishers and scammers.

How do Malwares infect devices?

The main ways of infection on devices are:

•Social medias
•Fraudulent websites
•"Free" programs (with gift)
•Infected devices USB/CDs/DVDs
•Mails not requested.

How to detect Malwares?

These are the main signs:

1.A slow, crashing or freezing computer.
2.Blue screen of death (BSOD).
3.Programmes opening and closing automatically or altering themselves
4.Lack of storage space.
5.Increased pop-ups, toolbars and other unwanted programs.
6.Emails and messages being sent without you prompting them.
7.Apps running in background without your permission as camera.

How to prevent from malwares?

1.Using official antiviruses.
2.Avoid downloading files from unknown websites.
3.Do not open mails from unknown senders.
4.Check sender's name to verify if it's not a fake mail.
5.Do not click unknown links.
6.Do not give your personal information to unknown sites.
7.Do not try to hack a social media account with a supposed "Hacker Website" they're fake sites that stole information and spread malwares.''')

cryptography = ('''What is Cryptography?

Cryptography is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties called adversaries.

How it works?

Cryptography works by converting ordinary plain text into unintelligible text and vice-versa. It is a method of storing and transmitting data in a particular form so that only those for whom it is intended can read and process it. Cryptography not only protects data from theft or alteration, but can also be used for user authentication.

Types of cryptographic techniques used in general:

1. Symmetric-key cryptography:
BotPublic-key cryptographyh the sender and receiver share a single key. The sender uses this key to encrypt plaintext and send the cipher text to the receiver. On the other side the receiver applies the same key to decrypt the message and recover the plain text.

2. Public-key cryptography:
This is the most revolutionary concept in the last 300-400 years. In Public-Key Cryptography two related keys (public and private key) are used. Public key may be freely distributed, while its paired private key, remains a secret. The public key is used for encryption and for decryption private key is used.

3. Hash Functions:
No key is used in this algorithm. A fixed-length hash value is computed as per the plain text that makes it impossible for the contents of the plain text to be recovered. Hash functions are also used by many operating systems to encrypt passwords.
Here we can find cyphers as MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512.

Now let's meet some cryptography tools:

1. Security Token/Authentication Token: this is the one that is considered as the cryptography tool. Using the security token, one can authenticate the user. It is also used to provide statefulness to the HTTP protocol. 

2. CertMgr.exe: this is the tool that is defined by Microsoft as the cryptography tools. The file can be installed as it has the exe extension. The file allows you to create and manage the certificate.

3. Docker: the dooker is nothing but a container that allows the user to develop a large application within it. The data that are kept inside the docket as kept in encrypted form.
The interesting part about docker is, in addition to the data, the files are also kept encrypted so that no one without proper key access could access it.

4. SignTool.exe: this tool is one of the more important cryptography tools that is used by Microsoft to sign the file. This application works as the authority that can add a signature with any of the file. In addition to that, it also adds the time stamp with the file.

5. Authentication using Key: the data that is encrypted needs the key to decrypt it. The normal data is something that could be understood by the normal user while the encrypted data is different from the original data.
In Authentication using Key, there are two types of approaches in Encryption, Symmetric Encryption and Asymmetric Encryption

In symmetric encryption, the key used to encrypt the data is the same key that will be used to decrypt the data.

In asymmetric encryption, the data will be encrypted with one key while it uses another key to get it decrypted. The keys are considered as private and public key based on which key is used for what purpose.

6. Codec: it's an apk that encodes plain text in cryptographic algorithms and vice versa like:
Ascii, Binary, Upper Case, Lower Case, Upside down, Superscript, Subscript, Base 32, Base64 and more.''')

steganography = ('''What is steganography?

Steganography is the use of various methods to hide information from unwanted eyes. In ancient times, steganography was mostly done physically.
Steganography is the practice of hiding of one file within another.

How it works?

Steganography works by hiding information in a way that doesn’t arouse suspicion. One of the most popular techniques is 'least significant bit (LSB) steganography. In this type of steganography, the information hider embeds the secret information in the least significant bits of a media file.

Differences between steganography and cryptography:

Steganography is often compared to cryptography.
Steganography hides information and cryptography focuses on rendering the data unreadable to everyone except its intended recipient.

Now let's see some tools:

1.Xiao Steganography is a hybrid steganography tool that allows users to hide files within image (BMP) or audio (WAV) files. 

2.SSuite Picsel takes a different approach to image steganography. Rather than providing a single carrier image, the user provides a carrier image and a key image. The key image is used as a secret and is necessary to extract the hidden text file from the carrier image.

3.Steghide is an open-source steganography tool that is capable of hiding data in image or audio files.

4.OpenPuff is a "professional steganography tool" that allows users to conceal files in image, audio, video, or Flash files. It provides a wide array of features to protect hidden data from discovery.

5.Camouflage is unique among the tools that we have discussed here since it allows any file to be hidden within any other file. Camouflage also provides encryption functionality to users and scrambles the contents of the hidden file before appending it to the original file.

6.Netcross is a steganography tool used for establishing covert IP channels across network perimeters with strong firewall rules. It uses DNS resolution requests and responses to carry data back and forth across the firewall.''')

cryptos = ('''What is bitcoin?

Bitcoin is a digital currency which operates free of any central control or the oversight of banks or governments. Instead it relies on peer-to-peer software and cryptography.

It was created in 2008 by the author going by the name Satoshi Nakamoto and the network was officially launched on 9 January 2009.

How it works?

A public ledger records all bitcoin transactions and copies are held on servers around the world.

Every transaction is publicly broadcast to the network and shared from node to node. Every ten minutes or so these transactions are collected together by miners into a group called a block and added permanently to the blockchain. This is the definitive account book of bitcoin.

In the same way a dollar is divided into 100 cents, bitcoin can be divided into 8 digits 1.00000000 which are called "Satoshis" and are the smallest fraction of a bitcoin, you can buy the amount you want.

Besides, if you want to buy or sell a product, it's recommended to use the lighting network which is faster like chat messages and has less fees unlike the onchain network which has high fees.

What is bitcoin mining?

Mining is the process that maintains the bitcoin network and also how new coins are brought into existence.

All transactions are publicly broadcast on the network and miners bundle large collections of transactions together into blocks by completing a cryptographic calculation that’s extremely hard to generate but very easy to verify. The first miner to solve the next block broadcasts it to the network and if proven correct is added to the blockchain. That miner is then rewarded with an amount of newly created bitcoin.

Inherent in the bitcoin software is a hard limit of 21 million coins. There will never be more than that in existence. The total number of coins will be in circulation by 2140. Roughly every four years the software makes it twice as hard to mine bitcoin by reducing the size of the rewards.

How to win?

Well, as we know bitcoin value is unstable, it goes up and down every time so we have to buy when the value comes down and so we'll see important earnings when the value goes up again. Buy as much criptos as possible, but not stay with bitcoin only buy other cryptos like Ethereum, Dogecoin or Shiba Inu these last two have a good future.
It's risky however most of people see earnings after some weeks and never lose their investment.

So far countries like El Salvador use bitcoin as legal tender to avoid high fees of banks and increase its economy, this represent an important step for the future of crypto currencies in the world.

You can start with Binance or with Coinbase app, download it and buy the coins you want and stay alert with every step the crypto takes, if the value comes down or goes up.

Remember that bitcoin network can't be hacked but you can mine by your own using some scripts in php language.

Luck crack :)''')

reverse = ('''What is Reverse engineering?

Reverse engineering is taking apart an object to see how it works in order to duplicate or enhance the object.

Reverse engineering presents a serious risk to applications, making possible to decompile the apps and review the source code. Any information including API URLs, API keys, and API secrets hard-coded can be found in apk files with reverse engineering.

Bad hackers use the information of an application to take apart programs to create malicious versions of them and so is how they make mod apks.
People download these files to avoid ads, purchase features or full apk but this is a risk for users if they download these files from unknown websites due to this mods might contain malwares.
So if you download this kind of files, make sure to use trustable sites like AN1, Apk4All, ApkHome and more. Always be carefully.

There are some tools for reverse engineering and use them for educational and ethical purposes only, here some of them:

1.IDA Pro: from Hex-Rays it's considered by industry insiders to be the top reverse-engineering tool, not only because of its price tag, but because of its feature set.

2.Ghidra: it supports Windows, macOS, and Linux. Its feature set includes disassembly, assembly, decompilation, graphing, and scripting.

3.Binary Ninja: made by Vector 35, prides itself on its ease of use, making automation easier and more approachable than other solutions in the market. It supports 64-bit Linux Ubuntu, macOS 10.13, and 64-bit Windows 10, as well as PE.COFF, ELF, Mach-O, .NES, and raw binary files.

4.Hopper: it is a disassembler for macOS and Linux. It can disassemble, decompile, and debug 32- and 64-bit executables. The Mac version uses the Cocoa framework, while the Linux edition uses Qt 5.

5.ApkTool: it focuses on reverse engineering third-party, closed, binary Android apps. The open-source program can decode resources to nearly their original form, making changes in them, and rebuilding them back to binary APK/JAR.
Java 7 is required to use the program.

social = ('''What is Social Engineering?

Social engineering is the term used for a broad range of malicious activities accomplished through human interactions. It uses psychological manipulation to trick users into making security mistakes or giving away sensitive information.

Social engineering attacks happen in one or more steps. A perpetrator first investigates the intended victim to gather necessary background information, such as potential points of entry and weak security protocols, needed to proceed with the attack. Then, the attacker moves to gain the victim’s trust and provide stimuli for subsequent actions that break security practices, such as revealing sensitive information or granting access to critical resources.

An attacker make use of the 7 capital sins:

1.Pride
2.Greed
3.Lust
4.Gluttony
5.Anger
6.Envy
7.Sloth

An example is that if someone is full lazy, then the hacker could easily send a phishing email to the victim about an advertising saying "Earn money from home without doing anything".

The hacker also makes use of psychological tactics to controll to the victim such as:

•Reciprocity
•Shortage
•Authority
•Consistensy
•Sympathy
•Consensus

An expert attacker make use of many methods to get enough information as possible, here some of them:

•Digital methods:

1.Phising:
In this case the criminal sends a compromising email that tells you that any of your social media accounts has an inusal activity or any other pretext like promotions, free gift, offers.
As we see in the above example, the attacker sends an interesting email based on the victim actitude to convince it.

2.Spear phishing:
This is a more targeted version of the phishing scam whereby an attacker chooses specific individuals or enterprises. They then tailor their messages based on characteristics, job positions, and contacts belonging to their victims to make their attack less conspicuous

3.Scarewares:
This involves victims being bombarded with false alarms and fictitious threats. Users are deceived to think their system is infected with malware, prompting them to install software that has no real benefit (other than for the perpetrator) or is malware itself.

•Phisical methods:

1.Pretexting:
Here an attacker obtains information through a series of cleverly crafted lies. The scam is often initiated by a perpetrator pretending to need sensitive information from a victim so as to perform a critical task.

2.Face to face:
The perpetrator generate trust with the victim, an expert perpetrator can read all psysical gestures like smile, embarrasment, fear, movements. If he realizes that the victim is scared, he makes everything possible to generate a comfortable environment.
And then he starts making questions like family, job, study, friends. 

How to avoid attacks?

To avoid being victim of Social Engineering attacks you don't have to give sensitive information to anyone neither on your bios of social medias accounts.
Remember that the attacker is not only an unknown person but a close one. For this reason you must never trust nobody, don't tell your dreams, goals, plans to anyone neither your friends.
And a last advice "Do not surprise if someone you love betrays you".
